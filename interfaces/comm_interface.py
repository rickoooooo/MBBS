This acts as a base class for other communication interfaces. Current build-in comm interfaces are functional for Meshtastic
packets via connecting to a Meshtastic device over TCP, and a simple TCP socket server interface which is helpful for debugging
and testing new features. Other interfaces can be build in this 'interfaces' subdirectory, though code would need to be updated to
instantiate the new interface.
